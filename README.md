# Future Distribution Grids

The goal of this project is to enhance the EE4375: Finite Element Modelling for Electrical Energy Applications course. It mostly entails applying finite element method (FEM) knowledge to the modeling of a power transformer's magnetic field, thermal field, and electrical circuit parameters.

The code is mostly written in Julia, a programming language, and is used to construct FEM models to calculate the iron and copper losses in power transformers and, in addition, to analyze the substation's temperature.
